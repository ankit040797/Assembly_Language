### Overview
The **Assembly Language Program Executor** application is designed to parse and execute a simplified assembly language program, which includes basic operations such as `move` (`MV`), `add` (`ADD`), and `show` (`SHOW`). The application processes these commands, updates internal registers, and stores the result. It also integrates with Redis to track the success and failure of operations.

### Technologies Used
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **File Storage**: Plain text files
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Dependency Management**: Maven

### Data Models

#### ProgramResult
- Represents the result of executing an assembly language program.
- Contains fields for:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the result.
  - `programText`: The assembly language code executed.
  - `result`: Output generated by executing the code.

### Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Main**: Contains the Java source code.
- **Controller**: Contains controller classes for handling HTTP requests.
- **Model**: Contains entity classes for data models.
- **Repository**: Contains repository interfaces for database operations.
- **Service**: Contains service classes for business logic.
- **resources**: Contains application configuration files, including `application.properties`.
- **test**: Contains test classes.

### Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/ankitsingh/assembly-language-executor.git
   - Open the project in your chosen IDE.
- Configure your database connection in the application.properties or application.yml file.
- Run the Spring Boot application.


## API Endpoints
- POST /program/execute: Executes a provided assembly language program.
- Request Body: Contains the assembly language code to be executed.
- Response: The result of executing the code, including any output or errors.

## Project Summary
- This application is built using Spring Boot and Java.
- It allows users to execute a simplified assembly language program and get the results.
- The program parses commands such as 'MV', 'ADD', and 'SHOW', updates internal state, and stores the result.
- Redis is used to track and increment success and failure counters based on command execution.
- The project follows a structured architecture with controllers, models, services, and repositories.
